@Component({
selector: 'app-user-panel',
template: `<div class="user-panel">{{ getUserName() }}</button>`,
})
export class UserPanelComponent {
private _user;

constructor(
private _authService: AuthService,
) {
this._authService
.user
.subscribe(user => {
this._user = user;
});
}
public getUserName() {
return this._user.name;
}}

Answer:

1) What are the problems in this code snippet?
	1) Div is not properly closed instead closed with button tag.
	2) there is no styles or styleUrls
	3) _user variable does'nt have a type.
	4) Better to have service calls in ngOnit instead of constructor.
	5) Subscription not unsubscribed.

2) How can we solve them?
	1) close the div with </div>
	2) add inline styles or external css file for user-panel if its not diclared in style.css.
	3) declare _user with its class type.
	4) implement OnInit to component and ngOnInit function. Than move constructor code to ngOninit
	5) Every subscription should be managed with first(), take(1) or unsubscribe.

3) If there are multiple options to solve them, what benefits and drawbacks of
each method?
	1) we can make our service public and instead of function, with async pipe we can display value dirtectly in html. will reduce lot of code.
